# Recent sightings of California Brown Pelicans

This repo pulls data from the [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) API and publishes it as [an Atom feed](https://simonw.github.io/recent-california-brown-pelicans/atom.xml) so I can subscribe to new pelican photos in [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/).

See [Building and deploying a custom site using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages](https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/github-pages) for implementation details.
